**Persian Stremio** is a community-maintained Stremio addon that aggregates Iranian and international streaming sources, delivering movies, series, and live TV directly inside Stremio.

This project is a **community fork** of [stremio-ir-providers](https://github.com/MrMohebi/stremio-ir-providers) by [MrMohebi](https://github.com/MrMohebi). It continues development with additional providers, performance improvements, bug fixes, IPTV support, and ongoing maintenance.
